  - ### Exercise 00: Megaphone

    Just to make sure that everybody is awake, write a program that behaves as follows:

    $>./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
    SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
    $>./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
    DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
    $>./megaphone
    * LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *

  - ### Exercise 01: My Awasome PhoneBook

  Welcome to the 80s and their unbelievable technology! Write a program that behaves like a crappy awasome phonebook software.

  You have to implement two classes:

  - PhoneBook
    - It has an array of contacts.
    - It can store a maximum of 8 contacts. If the user tries to add a 9th contact, replace the oldest one by the new one.
    - Please note that dynamic allocation is forbidden.
  - Contact
    - Stands for a phonebook contact.

  In your code, the phonebook must be instantiated as an instance of the PhoneBook class. Same thing for the contacts. Each one of them must be instantiated as an instance of the Contact class. You're free to desing the classes as you like but keep in mind that anything that wall always be used inside a class is private, and that anything that can be used outside a class is public.

  On program start-up, the phonebook is empty and the user is prompted to enter one of three commands. The program only accepts ADD, SEARCH and EXIT.

  - ADD: save a new contact
    - If the user enters this command, they are prompted to input the information of the new contact one field at a time. Once all the fields have been completed, add the contact to the phonebook.
    - The contact fields are: first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and darkest secret. A saved contact can't have empty fields.
  - SEARCH: display a specific contact
    - Display the saved contacts as a list of 4 columns: index, first name, last name and nickname.
    - Each column must be 10 characters wide. A pipe character ('|') separates them. The text must be right-aligned. If the text is longer than the column, is must be runcated and the last displayable character must be replaced by a dot ('.').
    - Then, prompt the user again for the index of the entry to display. If the index is out of range or wrong, define a relevant behavior. Otherwise, display the contact information, one field per line.
  - EXIT
    - The program quits and the contacts are lost forever!
  - Any other input is dicarded.

  Once a command has been correctly executed, the program waits for another one. It stops when the user inputs EXIT.
  Give a relevant name to your executable.
